0.1     - Initial version.
0.2     - Fixed a bug with character set conversion which caused crashes on systems with a
          different "locale" than en_US.
0.3     - Set a left margin for better readability.
        - Quitting the User-select window will keep the user window open now. Quitting the
          user window will however re-open the user-select window if it was previously
          closed.
        - Port number now defaults to 1024 instead of 0 when creating a new user.
        - Latest connected user is now selected by default at startup.
        - Keypad-keys now default to <Mod2><KP_xxx> at user creation. The previous <KP_xxx>
          keypad macros didn't seem to work on X. 
        - Bugfix: new users were not added to the user list in a proper way which caused
          an infinite loop at close on some occassions.
        - Added a timer mechanism.
0.4     - Added an optional auto-reconnect feature.
        - Variables can now be used in input (%variable_name).
        - Bugfix: connection errors were not shown anymore.
        - Created the general preference window.
0.5     - Color bleed fix for muds (smaugs) that do not conform to the ANSI standard. 
          Thanks to Patrick H. for pointing it out.
        - Bugfix: auto-reconnect timer didn't always start when required.
        - Fixed a bug with the reconnect dialog which caused a lockup on some systems. 
        - Added Debian RPM-package support. Done by Sean Middleditch.
0.6     - Added customizable characters for command stack, variable sign, command sign
          and blocks.
        - Added a maximum buffer size feature (set in maximum lines).
0.7     - Fixed a bug in the telnet protocol: all IAC's were treated as at least 3 bytes
          which should have been at least 2 bytes.
        - Added an #echo command to echo text to the output window.
        - Added an "all" option to #cont_timer and #stop_timer.
        - Added a #mute command to mute the informational command output.
        - Added a #cmd command to process commands on other user windows.
        - Added login/password trigger option at user-creation.
        - Added an Edit-button to the user-selector to edit a user without having to go
          online.
        - Added a #capture command to send text to an additional window.
        - Changed the trigger core to check incoming buffers line-by-line instead of big
          data chunks.
0.8     - Improved implementation of the IACs. IACs are now processed before character set
          conversion and are escaped when transmitted within data.
        - Trigger buffer could overflow in one situation. Fixed.
        - Added support for ANSI background colors and underlining.
        - Support for MCCP (version 2) was added.
0.9     - IAC IAC was not handled right, fixed.
        - Colors were messed up for servers using unicode character-set, fixed.

        - Added flags for toggling input echo and auto-clear of the input bar.
        - Added support for the CSI character.
        - Implemented proper NAWS (window size negotiation) support.
0.10    - MCCP receive buffer did not expand when required. Inflate did not return a
          buffer full status code as expected.
        - Added a #shell command to execute commands in the background.
1.0     - Added a oneshot timer which deletes itself as it expires. Contributed by Thomas R Kimpton.
        - Added mnemonics for all the buttons. Contributed by Thomas R Kimpton.
        - Added shortcuts for cut/paste/copy etc. Contributed by Thomas R Kimpton.
        - Fixed a bug that caused multiple preference windows to stack.
        - Fixed a bug in triggers: variables at the end of the trigger weren't parsed
          right, which could cause corrupted values within that variable.
        - Changed layout of the user-file, for easier addition of new variables.
        - Wrapping modes added (Word wrap, Character wrap, No wrap).
        - Adding the parameter "date" to the #log command, will create log files with
          a filename starting with the current date.
        - Added a #cls command to clear user and capture windows.
        - Improved handling of telnet protocol and ESC sequences.
        - Added a speed path custom character which allows speed paths to be processed
          in the input bar.
        - Added history to a drag down box for easy access to history.
        - Ported to MS windows.
