History
-------

I started coding this mud client a long time back ('96) when I had to use
telnet to MUD. At first it was only intended for personal use on my own MUD
(darkwiz.betterbox.net 6969) and so I never thought it would come this far.
Also didn't work on it for a LONG time, until just recently (early 2000) when
I decided to add the poll() system call. I released 1.6 and kept working on
it... up to MUDix version 4.0. However, MUDix was still only a console application
and although it could run in an X-term on X windows, it wasn't suitable to be
run on X. Therefore I decided to start working on gMUDix somewhere in 2002 after
not working on MUDix for about a year or so. I've ported MUDix to X fairly quick
and within a month I had gMUDix up and running to a fairly decent X application :).
I must say that GTK+ is a very easy to use library for writing X applications.

Well I hope you enjoy this program as much as I loved to write it ;)

And of course, have fun MUDing :)
